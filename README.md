---------- what is this project ---------------------
A cli application for linux that keeps track of which videos you have watched and which you haven't.
If you download and watch anime or web series or download playlists from youtube then you might run into situations when you can't remember which was the last video that you watched.
This program was written to help out in those situations.

----------- requirements ------------------------------
This program assumes that you have vlc media player installed in your system and also python3.

------------------instructions----------------------------

Open the terminal and go to the directory which contains the videos and then just run the program as you would run a python program.
The rest is simple.
